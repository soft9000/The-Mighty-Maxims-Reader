# The Mighty Maxims Reader
The Mighty Maxims Reader (MMR) is a free & open console user interface (TUI/CUI.) 

Designed to share classic books first, the never ending journey is to share also any and all insights into them.

!["Keep on 'Learnin"](https://github.com/soft9000/The-Mighty-Maxims-Reader/blob/main/graphics/TheMightyMaximsReader.png)

Our mission is to be sharing our planet's very best in classic readable works - to infinity ... and beyond?

# Use Cases
1. Share classic books.
2. Keep notes within each.
3. Backup / Export / Import notes for and from others.
4. Create HTML reports that can share individual note-linkings.

From our pockets to the clouds ditching GUI's permits maximum - dare I say global - software re-use.
